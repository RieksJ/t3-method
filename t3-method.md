# Streamlining Task Management: The Task Triage Toolbox (T3) method

## Abstract

This document introduces the 'Task Triage Toolbox' (T3) method, a structured approach to improving task management by helping individuals and organizations focus on tasks that deliver meaningful results. By answering three key questions about any task—regarding its outcomes, its users, and the use of its results—the T3 method offers a practical framework for reducing inefficiency, enhancing productivity, and aligning tasks with strategic goals. The paper outlines how to apply the method, addresses common barriers to its implementation, and provides guidance on overcoming challenges.

## 1. Introduction

In many workplaces, individuals and teams often spend time on tasks that fail to produce tangible benefits or align with broader objectives. Vague goals, unclear target users, and a lack of understanding of a task’s purpose often lead to inefficiency, resource waste, and frustration. This is a widespread issue, as numerous studies confirm the prevalence of poor task management and misaligned objectives across industries.

For instance, the Project Management Institute found that unclear objectives were responsible for 37% of project failures ([PMI, 2020](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/influences-project-failure-6225)), while the Standish Group’s CHAOS report highlighted that nearly 71% of IT projects were unsuccessful due to unclear user needs ([Standish Group, 2020](https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/CHAOSReport2015-Final.pdf)). Similar surveys by McKinsey & Company and Gartner report that a significant portion of project budgets and employee time are wasted due to task misalignment and inefficient management ([McKinsey & Company, 2018](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/the-organization-blog/aligning-employees-with-the-companys-strategic-goals); [Gartner, 2019](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3873863/the-2019-gartner-project-management-benchmarks)).

These inefficiencies are compounded by cognitive limitations, such as biases and procrastination, and organizational dynamics that encourage the continuation of low-impact tasks. Cognitive biases, such as those identified by Daniel Kahneman, as well as social pressures and the "knowing-doing gap" noted by Pfeffer and Sutton, all contribute to the persistence of ineffective behaviors ([Kahneman, 2011](https://www.farrarstrausgiroux.com); [Pfeffer & Sutton, 2000](https://hbr.org/product/the-knowing-doing-gap-how-smart-companies-turn-knowledge-into-action/1408E-KND-ENG)).

The **Task Triage Toolbox (T3) method** addresses these challenges by offering a simple yet powerful framework for evaluating tasks. It centers around three critical questions: What are the concrete results of the task? Who will use these results? And what will these users do with them? By answering these questions, individuals and organizations can better prioritize their efforts, ensure alignment with strategic goals, and focus on tasks that generate real value.

This paper outlines the T3 method in detail, its practical applications, and how it can be used to address common task management challenges. The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 introduces the T3 method, Section 3 discusses its benefits, and Section 4 provides practical guidelines for its implementation. The paper concludes with strategies to encourage adoption of the method.

## 3. The T3 Method

The Task Triage Toolbox (T3) method is a structured approach that helps clarify the purpose and scope of any task by answering three fundamental questions. These questions ensure that tasks are well-defined, relevant, and aligned with the needs of those who will use the results. By doing so, the T3 method improves task specification, assignment, and execution, ultimately leading to more meaningful and productive outcomes.

The three key questions are as follows:

1. **What are the concrete results of the task?**
2. **Which (groups of) individual people will actually be using these results?**
3. **What is it that these people will actually (need to) be doing with the results?**

The following sections will elaborate on when and where to use the method, introduce the "well-formedness criteria" that help assess the quality of answers to these questions, and identify the risks of not having clear and complete answers.

### 3.1 When to Use the Method

While the T3 method can theoretically be applied to any task, its usefulness depends on the context and the importance of the task in question. Not every task requires deep reflection and detailed answers to the three questions. The method is most beneficial for tasks that have a direct impact on other people or strategic goals.

For example:
- **Routine tasks** like making coffee or sending routine emails do not typically require the T3 method.
- **Intermediate tasks**, such as sending important invitations or drafting non-trivial communications, may benefit from using the T3 method to clarify purpose and expected outcomes.
- **Complex tasks** that involve design, production, or creating something for external use (e.g., a product, training program, or marketing campaign) greatly benefit from the method, as the answers to the three questions guide the decision-making process and ensure that the outcomes are aligned with the intended audience’s needs.

The T3 method is particularly valuable during:
- **Task design**: It ensures the task is well-defined and relevant.
- **Task execution**: It clarifies expectations and allows individuals to focus on meaningful results.
- **Task evaluation**: It measures efficiency and effectiveness, guiding improvement.
- **Resource justification**: It helps ensure resources are used efficiently, with clear outcomes in mind.
- **Task prioritization**: It enables decision-makers to prioritize tasks based on their impact and relevance.

Additionally, the process of answering the T3 questions for a task can itself be viewed as a subtask, subject to the same method: determining the results, users, and their activities with respect to the answers themselves.

### 3.2 Concrete Results

The first question, "What are the concrete results of the task?", focuses on identifying tangible or verifiable outcomes that will exist once the task is completed. These can be physical artifacts, like reports or presentations, or intangible results, such as new ideas, knowledge, or memories.

A well-formed answer should specify results that are easily verifiable. For example, the task of "creating a solid advice" is too vague. A more concrete answer would specify the form and content of the advice, such as a detailed report adhering to specific templates or guidelines.

Without clearly defined concrete results, a task may suffer from ambiguity, leading to misaligned expectations and objectives. Team members might not know what they are working toward, which can cause confusion, missed deadlines, and incomplete or unsatisfactory results. If the results are not verifiable, it becomes difficult to measure progress or determine whether the task has been successfully completed. As a method user, consider the task's importance and how much effort you should spend defining its concrete outcomes based on its complexity and impact.

### 3.3 Actual Users

The second question, "Which (groups of) individual people will actually be using these results?", ensures that the task is designed with the specific users in mind. The answer should clearly identify the individuals or groups who will use the results, referred to as "result users." It is important to list actual users, not potential ones.

For example, vague answers like "the customer" or "readers" are insufficient. Instead, specify exact users or well-defined groups such as "Members of Parliament" or "the finance department."

If the actual result users are not clearly identified, the task may produce results that do not meet the needs of those who are intended to use them. This can result in wasted effort, as the outputs may be irrelevant, impractical, or misaligned with user requirements. Misunderstanding who the result users are can also lead to poor prioritization of resources. The more significant the task, the more essential it is to invest time in accurately identifying the result users to ensure the output serves its purpose effectively.

### 3.4 Fit-for-Purposeness

The third question, "What is it that these result users will actually be doing with the results?", focuses on how the results will be applied by the result users. This ensures that the task's outcomes are not only relevant but also functional and aligned with the specific needs of those who will use them.

A well-formed answer should describe the specific activities that result users will undertake with the task’s outputs. For instance, if the result is a report, the answer might detail whether the users will use it to make decisions, create further documentation, or inform strategic planning. Additionally, it’s important to highlight any characteristics that make the result particularly valuable or fit for its intended purpose—such as the format, level of detail, or accuracy required for the result to be usable in those activities.

If the purpose of the result is unclear or poorly defined, the output may not be used effectively, or worse, may not be used at all. Misalignment between the result and its intended use can lead to frustration, resource waste, and missed opportunities for impact. As a method user, carefully consider how critical the task is and allocate effort to ensuring the result is tailored to fit its specific purpose for the result users.

## 4. Testing and Evaluating the T3 Method

The T3 method was developed to improve task management by helping individuals and organizations focus on tasks that deliver meaningful results. The expected benefits included greater clarity in task objectives, improved communication among stakeholders, better prioritization of tasks, and increased efficiency and effectiveness in task execution.

To validate these expectations, the **Groningen Experiment** was conducted at TNO’s Groningen location. The experiment aimed to test the hypothesis: "TNOers that conscientiously apply the T3 method are more efficient and effective in executing activities than those that do not." This chapter outlines the setup and results of that experiment, providing valuable insights for readers looking to implement the T3 method in their own contexts.

### 4.1 The Groningen Experiment

The Groningen Experiment sought to test the real-world applicability of the T3 method. It involved several activities, including participant recruitment, feedback sessions, and data collection over the course of three months. The main risk identified was that participants might leave the experiment prematurely, potentially undermining the evaluation. To mitigate this risk, participants made an explicit commitment to apply the method and attend regular feedback sessions.

The experiment's main objectives were to:
- Ensure participants could independently apply the method and become more efficient and effective in their work.
- Raise awareness within TNO about the method and its benefits.
- Identify practical obstacles encountered when using the method and propose solutions.

The experiment began with a physical introductory session to recruit participants. This session introduced the method and the experiment, highlighting the potential benefits for daily work. Attendees were asked to commit to using the method and to participate in a series of 6 feedback sessions. During these sessions, participants shared their experiences, challenges, and benefits from applying the method, creating a collaborative learning environment.

### 4.2 Costs and Benefits of Applying the Method

As expected, participants reported several tangible benefits from applying the T3 method. These benefits included increased efficiency, improved task prioritization, and greater mental clarity in managing tasks.

One participant noted that using the method helped them save approximately 20% of their time when writing reports. This was achieved by clearly defining the report’s purpose and focusing only on the necessary content. Another participant found that using the method helped them clarify the objectives of recurring meetings, leading to a decision to skip some meetings that were deemed unnecessary.

The method’s benefits also extended to project management. One project manager used the T3 method to structure a meeting with work package leaders, which resulted in clearer direction and more effective coordination. Similarly, in a technical demonstration scenario, the T3 method helped a participant define the changes needed to prepare for a management presentation, ultimately leading to a more successful outcome.

However, the costs of applying the method were generally minimal. Participants acknowledged that the time spent answering the T3 questions was worth the effort. One participant mentioned that although they needed regular reminders to apply the method, the benefits far outweighed the time investment. Others found that while the method did not always change their decisions, it did make their reasoning clearer and more deliberate.

### 4.3 Perceived Obstacles

Despite the clear benefits, participants encountered some obstacles when applying the T3 method. A common challenge was difficulty in consistently reminding themselves to use the method, particularly after the initial excitement of the experiment had worn off. Some participants reported that they focused only on the first question (the concrete results), which still provided some value but limited the overall impact of the method.

Another significant obstacle was the discomfort that arose when asking the T3 questions in group settings, such as meetings with customers or senior colleagues. Participants found that their discussion partners were not always familiar with this type of questioning, which sometimes led to awkwardness or avoidance. However, over time, many recognized the value of the questions, even if they initially resisted providing answers.

Getting answers to the second and third questions (about result users and what they would do with the results) was another challenge. In some cases, stakeholders were reluctant to engage in the process, making it difficult to fully apply the method. Nevertheless, some participants developed strategies, such as using a "script" to ask these questions more tactfully, especially in sensitive situations.

### 4.4 The Role of Feedback Sessions

Feedback sessions were a critical component of the experiment, serving multiple purposes. First, they provided a structured environment for participants to stay engaged with the method. Knowing that they would be asked to report on their progress helped ensure that participants continued to apply the method, even when they encountered obstacles.

Second, the feedback sessions fostered collaboration among participants. By sharing their experiences, participants were able to learn from one another and discover solutions to the challenges they faced. For example, one participant who struggled with stakeholder engagement received practical advice from others who had faced similar issues. These exchanges helped participants refine their approach and become more comfortable using the T3 method.

Third, the sessions created a space for participants to reflect on the benefits they were experiencing. As participants became more familiar with the method, they reported feeling more confident and motivated to continue using it. The feedback sessions not only helped participants overcome practical obstacles but also reinforced the method’s value, providing an opportunity for real-time learning and growth.

Finally, the feedback sessions strengthened relationships among participants. As they shared their successes and challenges, participants developed a sense of camaraderie, which contributed to a positive learning environment. This social aspect of the feedback sessions played a crucial role in maintaining participant engagement throughout the experiment.

### Conclusion

The Groningen Experiment successfully validated many of the expected benefits of the T3 method. Participants reported increased efficiency, better task prioritization, and greater clarity in their work. While obstacles were encountered, such as discomfort in asking the T3 questions and difficulties in obtaining full answers, participants generally found ways to overcome these challenges. The feedback sessions played a crucial role in supporting participants and facilitating peer learning, making the experiment not only a test of the method but also a valuable collaborative experience.

The results of this experiment suggest that the T3 method can be an effective tool for improving task management in a variety of settings. With practice and support, individuals and teams can become more efficient, focused, and deliberate in their work, making the method a valuable addition to any organizational toolkit.
