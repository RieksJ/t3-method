# Streamlining Task Management: The Task Triage Toolbox method

## Abstract

In today's fast-paced and complex work environments, efficient task management is crucial for success. Many organizations and individuals struggle with identifying and prioritizing tasks effectively, leading to wasted resources and missed opportunities. This paper introduces the Task Triage Toolbox method, a simple yet powerful approach to task management that focuses on clarifying objectives, identifying actual users, and ensuring tasks are fit for their intended purpose. By addressing common inefficiencies and cognitive biases, the method aims to enhance productivity and alignment with strategic goals. The paper outlines the problem, describes the method in detail, and provides practical guidance for implementation, supported by real-world examples and case studies.

## 1. Introduction

In many workplaces, people often find themselves engaged in tasks that do not seem to add much value. For example, employees might spend hours creating detailed reports that no one reads or participating in meetings that do not lead to actionable outcomes. While these activities might have 'good' reasons behind them, such as following company protocols or demonstrating diligence, they often result in inefficiency and frustration.

There is a pressing need for a method that helps individuals and organizations identify and focus on tasks that truly matter. The Task Triage Toolbox method offers a structured approach to achieve this by asking three critical questions about any task: What are the concrete results? Who are the actual users? What will these users do with the results? By answering these questions, task objectives become clearer, and efforts are better aligned with meaningful outcomes.

This paper proposes the Task Triage Toolbox (T3) method, which is designed to improve task clarity, relevance, and effectiveness. Implementing this method can help reduce wasted efforts, enhance productivity, and ensure that tasks contribute to strategic goals. However, it also requires a shift in mindset and careful consideration of each task's purpose and impact.

The structure of this paper is as follows: Section 2 outlines the common problems in task management and provides evidence of their prevalence. Section 3 introduces the T3 method in detail. Section 4 discusses the expected benefits of applying this method. Section 5 provides practical implementation guidelines, including a step-by-step guide and solutions to common challenges. Section 6 suggests strategies for encouraging adoption of the method, and Section 7 concludes the paper with a summary of key points and a call to action.

## 2. Problem Statement

Many organizations and individuals struggle with task management, often spending time on activities that do not yield tangible benefits. Common issues include vague task objectives, unclear target users, and a lack of understanding of the task's ultimate purpose. These inefficiencies can lead to wasted resources and missed opportunities.

Studies and surveys provide substantial evidence of these inefficiencies. The Project Management Institute found that poor project management, including unclear objectives, was a primary factor in 37% of project failures, underscoring the need for well-defined task goals to ensure success ([PMI, 2020](https://www.pmi.org/learning/library/influences-project-failure-6225)). Similarly, the Standish Group's CHAOS Report revealed that only 29% of IT projects were successful, with many failures attributed to not clearly identifying end-users or their needs, resulting in products or solutions that do not meet user expectations ([Standish Group, 2020](https://www.standishgroup.com/sample_research_files/CHAOSReport2015-Final.pdf)).

Moreover, a survey by McKinsey & Company found that 70% of employees felt their work was not aligned with the company's strategic goals, indicating a widespread issue of tasks being carried out without a clear understanding of their purpose within the broader organizational context ([McKinsey & Company, 2018](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/the-organization-blog/aligning-employees-with-the-companys-strategic-goals)). Gartner reported that 20% of project budgets are typically wasted due to inefficiencies in task management and misalignment with project goals ([Gartner, 2019](https://www.gartner.com/en/documents/3873863/the-2019-gartner-project-management-benchmarks)). An article by Harvard Business Review highlights that organizations often miss out on strategic opportunities because they are bogged down with tasks that do not contribute to their long-term objectives ([Harvard Business Review, 2019](https://hbr.org/2019/03/why-so-many-strategic-initiatives-fail)). Additionally, Gallup found that only 35% of U.S. employees are engaged in their work, often due to a lack of clarity and purpose in their daily tasks, directly linked to unclear task objectives and misalignment with overall goals ([Gallup, 2020](https://www.gallup.com/workplace/321965/employee-engagement-holds-steady-first-half-2020.aspx)).

Despite knowing that certain tasks may be inefficient or ineffective, people often continue to engage in these activities due to a combination of cognitive limitations, biases, social influences, and organizational dynamics. Herbert Simon's concept of bounded rationality explains that individuals make decisions within the constraints of limited information and cognitive capabilities, often resulting in satisfactory rather than optimal choices ([Simon, 1955](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1884852)). Daniel Kahneman's research on cognitive biases reveals that people frequently rely on intuitive (System 1) thinking, which is prone to errors such as overconfidence, anchoring, and framing effects ([Kahneman, 2011](https://www.farrarstrausgiroux.com)). Piers Steel's work on procrastination indicates that individuals often delay or avoid tasks perceived as difficult or unpleasant, contributing to inefficiency ([Steel, 2007](https://doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.65)). Furthermore, Jeffrey Pfeffer and Robert Sutton highlight the "knowing-doing gap," where organizations fail to translate knowledge into action due to lack of clear objectives, bureaucratic inertia, and misaligned incentives ([Pfeffer & Sutton, 2000](https://hbr.org/product/the-knowing-doing-gap-how-smart-companies-turn-knowledge-into-action/1408E-KND-ENG)). Social pressures and the desire to conform also play a significant role, as individuals may undertake tasks to align with perceived expectations rather than objective efficiency. These factors collectively explain why inefficiency and ineffectiveness persist in both individual and organizational behaviors.

## 3. The Task Triage Toolbox method

The Task Triage Toolbox method revolves around three core questions that are designed to clarify (and enhance) the purpose and scope of any task. Having answers to these questions helps to improve the quality of task specifications, task assignment and task execution, and gives individuals more confidence that their efforts are directed towards actually meaningful and productive outcomes.

The questions are as follows:

1. "**What are the <u>concrete results</u> of the task?**"
2. "**Which (groups of) individual people will <u>actually</u> be using these results?**"
3. "**What is it that these people will <u>actually be doing</u> with the results?**"

### 3.1. Concrete Results

Answers to the first question ("**What are the <u>concrete results</u> of the task?**") should identify the concrete artifacts that will exist when the task is done (and that did not exist at the start). They can be tangible artifacts, such as documents, reports, presentations, but also intangibles such as new ideas, or enjoyable memories.

Answers should identify concrete artifacts, the existence of which is verifiable (auditable). Creating 'a solid advice' may be the name of a task, but since the existence of 'a solid advice' isn't verifiable, it doesn't qualify as an answer to this question. 

Ideally, answers to this question also specify any verifiable (auditable) characteristics that the results are expected to have. For example, a report may require that a particular template be used, is written in a given language, have an appendix that contains a glossary of terms and/or abbreviations used, etc.

Having a good answer to the question of concrete results ensures that tasks are clearly defined and their outcomes are measurable. This clarity helps in setting realistic expectations and provides a clear benchmark for evaluating task completion. It also facilitates better communication among team members and stakeholders, as everyone understands what is expected. Conversely, when the answer does not meet the qualifications, there is a risk of ambiguity and misunderstanding, leading to wasted effort, misaligned objectives, and potentially unsuccessful task outcomes.

### 3.2. Actual Users

Answers to the second question ("**Which (groups of) individual people will <u>actually</u> be using these results?**") should list the names of the individuals that will be using the results, and/or the names of a group of people, such as "Members of Parliament", for which it is clear who is, and who is not, a member. We will use the term 'consumers (of a result)' to refer to the set of individuals that will actually be using that result.

Answers should not refer to groups of individuals for which it cannot be established who is, and who is not a part of the group. For example, "the customer" or "readers" are not useful as an answer.

Note that consumers are individuals that will <u>*actually*</u> be using the results. There may be many other individuals that might <u>*potentially*</u> use the results, but these are not considered consumers. 

Identifying the actual users of a task's results ensures that the task is tailored to the needs and expectations of those who will benefit from it. This specificity helps in designing tasks that are relevant and useful, increasing the likelihood of the results being effectively utilized. It also aids in prioritizing resources and efforts towards outcomes that have a clear and direct impact. On

 the other hand, if the answer is vague or inaccurate, there is a risk of creating results that are misaligned with user needs, leading to dissatisfaction, underutilization, and wasted resources.

### 3.3. Fit-for-Purposeness

Answers to the third question ("**What is it that these people will <u>actually be doing</u> with the results?**") list the activities of every (group of) consumers for which the result is necessary.

Ideally, answers to this question also elaborate on the particular characteristics of the results that make it particularly valuable for being used in specific activities. 

Understanding what users will do with the results ensures that the task outcomes are designed to be fit for their intended purpose. This alignment helps in creating results that are not only relevant but also functional and valuable for specific activities. It enhances the practical application of the results, ensuring they meet the users' needs effectively. If this question is not adequately answered, there is a risk of producing results that are impractical or irrelevant, reducing their utility and impact.

### 3.4. When and Where to Use the Method

These questions may be answered in a number of situations:
- Whenever a task is designed. By answering these questions, the designer of the task can ensure the task is well-defined, relevant, and aligned with user needs.
- Whenever a person is asked to execute a task. By answering these questions, that person can clarify their objectives, understand the expectations, and focus their efforts on producing meaningful results.
- Whenever a person has been executing a task for some time (some tasks take a long time). By answering these questions, that person can reassess the task's direction, make necessary adjustments, and ensure continued alignment with the intended purpose.
- Whenever a task is being evaluated for efficiency and effectiveness. By answering these questions, the person that evaluates that task can measure its success, identify areas for improvement, and provide actionable feedback.

What we refer to by 'task' can in fact be many different things. It can be as large as a project, and work packages therein. It can be as small as reading a paper, attending a meeting, etc. {{evaluate this paragraph, and revise its contents so that the examples become appealing to the target audience.}}

## 4. Expected Benefits of the Task Triage Toolbox method

The Task Triage Toolbox method is envisaged to provide several significant benefits by addressing common barriers to effective task management, as identified by Simon, Kahneman, Steel, and Pfeffer. By providing a clear framework for task evaluation, the method is expected to help individuals and organizations overcome cognitive limitations, biases, and organizational dynamics that lead to inefficiency.

Firstly, the method is anticipated to increase efficiency by ensuring tasks are clearly defined with concrete results. This clarity will help in setting realistic expectations and provide measurable benchmarks for evaluating task completion. It is expected to reduce ambiguity and misunderstanding, leading to better resource allocation and successful task outcomes.

Secondly, the method aims to improve communication by requiring precise identification of the actual users of the task's results. This specificity is likely to ensure that tasks are tailored to the needs of those who will benefit from them, facilitating better stakeholder engagement and collaboration. It should also help in prioritizing efforts towards outcomes that have a clear and direct impact.

Thirdly, the method is designed to enhance task relevance by focusing on the intended use of the results. Understanding what users will do with the results ensures that task outcomes are designed to be functional and valuable. This alignment is expected to increase the practical application of the results, ensuring they meet users' needs effectively.

Overall, the Task Triage Toolbox method is expected to help individuals and organizations become more efficient, effective, and communicative by providing a structured approach to task evaluation and execution.

## 5. The Groningen Experiment

The 'Groningen Experiment' is an experiment that was conducted at the TNO location in Groningen (hence the name). The expermiment aimed at validating the hypothesis "TNOers that conscientiously apply the T3 mehod are more efficient and effective in executing activities than those that do not."

The experiment consisted of: 
1. Finding a set of TNOers that commit to use the method for some time.
3. Doing feedback sessions (once every 2/3 weeks, during 3 months) so as to support and stimulate participants to fulfill their commitment, and obtain all sorts of feedback related to the efficiency/effectivity, etc.
4. Collecting the feedback, analyse it, etc.
5. Writing a document that at least summarizes the experiment and its results.

The main risk we identified for this experiment is that participants would prematurely leave the experiment, as this could cause the following objectives to not be realized (as well as we could like):
- Participants can independently use the method where and when that helps them save time by becoming more efficient and effective;
- The method is well known (within TNO) and associated with at least the basic benefits (save time, become more efficient and effective);
- The construction of a list of practical obstacles that people can encounter when usig the method, and solutions that have been shown to work in practice.

As a result, we need to ensure participants make a clear commitment that they can actually fulfill, and they get help from their peers as they identify obstacles. 

### 5.1. Activity 1: Setting up the experiment

We decided to find the participants for this experiment by doing a (physical) introductory session for which we would invite everyone with 'home location' Groningen. In this session, we would explain the method and its expected benefits. Also, we would introduce the experiment, and explain that it would take some people that would actually be using this method for some time, and that would provide us with feedback about what does, and what doesn't work. In the end, we would ask them to decide whether or not to participate, and plan the feedback sessions with them.

The result of this activity we set out to produce is [an invitation](#appendix-a) that its recipients could then use to decide whether or not to join the introductory session. Thus, we mentioned that participating could benefit them in their daily work (becoming more efficient and effective, and saving time because of that). Also, knowing that some people will do anything for a free lunch, we arranged for a lunch.

The introductory session started with the lunch, in which attendees were asked to fill out a 1-page questionnaire in which they had to enter their name, and answer the following questions:

What am I (*fill in your name*) doing here, a.k.a.:
   1. What concrete results do I expect to see at the end of this kick-off session? (what can I show that exists? What criteria does it meet?)
   2. Who do I know/think will actually be using these results? (be concrete as you can – state names of individuals if possible)
   3. What is it that they must be able to do with these results? (be as concrete as you can – state activities for which they need these results)

This would give them a first taste of the method without being introduced to it. Also, having collected the papers would give us a baseline idea of where these colleagues were standing.

After lunch, and having collected the forms, we presented them with a slide in which the organizers Willem and Rieks had written [their answers these questions](#appendix-b).

This was followed by some stories in which the organizers shared their own experiences of using the method in various contexts, such as writing project proposals, writing project reports, articles, etc., doing presentations, reading articles, reports, emails, participating in meetings, seminars and the like, providing feedback/comments, getting insurance, buying fruit in the market, going to birthday parties, and so on and so forth. These stories were aimed to have attendees develop ideas as to where they could be using the method, and think a bit about what that would mean in terms of effort, obstacles they might encounter, etc.

Then, we asked them to write a commitment statement based on a pre-cooked [template](#appendix-c), which would serve them as a reminder of the questions, and that they were expected to keep (some) notes about how things were going, the obstacles they had encountered, the benefits and drawbacks and any other observations they would have and that might serve us in our evaluation of the method.

### 5.2 Activity 2: Feedback sessions

<!--[Sessies: 16 mei kickoff, 6 feedback sessies, gepland op: 3,24 juni, 15 juli, 5,26 aug, 16 sept]-->
The feedback sessions served a number of objectives:

1. it helps to ensure participants continue to participate. After all, not showing up is not a (real) option, given the explicit commitment they made. And showing up, knowing that you'll be asked how things go becomes increasingly unpleasant when you keep saying you have nothing to report. 
2. it helps participants to overcome obstacles they run into. Sharing such experiences, and getting feedback from the other participants regarding the extent in which others have experienced them, and ways that they have tried to come to grips with that, can put them on track again.
3. particants can become more intrinsically motivated as they experience the benefits that the method brings and they find ways to deal with possible obstacles.
4. sharing experiences with each other and seeing that all progress fosters relations between the participants, which in itself is a valuable experience for people that regularly see, and work with each other.

{{add other objectives if you can think of any}}

The structure of a feedback session is quite simple. When people have taken their lunch and sit down, everyone gets a turn in reporting about any progress or setbacks they have experienced, after which others are invited to react in a way that helps all of the participants. There can be situations that benefit from practical interventions, asking participants to do some additional exercises during the week(s) to come.

### 5.3 Observations - 

People on the mailing list of TNO location Groningen (roughly 100) were sent the invitation to the introductory session, and 15 showed up. We deliberately did not cater for recording the session, or the possibility to join online, to ensure the experience would not be {{fill in a good word here}} because of the presence of technology.

Filling in the template with the three questions was relatively easy for some, but most of them had trouble finding answers. 5 people answered all three questions, most of which were (almost suspisciously) consistent with texts from the invitation. 9 people either provided answers with question marks or other indicators of uncertainty, suggesting they had trouble either understanding what was asked, or formulating the answer. 1 person had answers for questions 1 and 2, but no clue regarding question 3.

This exercise results in an immediate experience in what T3 method is about, and the effects it can have with people. The idea behind it is that such experiences would be useful for them when deciding whether or not to participate in the experiment. Presenting the results of this exercise by Willem and Rieks (who did it up-front, of course) illustrated what answers could look like (for those that were still wondering), and also clarified the effects that these answers could have on designing the introduction session. This was further illustrated by the organizers presenting case-material from their own lives.

In the end, 10 out of the 15 attendees decided to commit to participate in the experiment. With them, we revised the agenda for feedback sessions to ensure the maximum number of them would be able to participate.

In the first feedback session, some participants noted that they had trouble reminding themselves to their commitment, which became more so after time progressed. One participant limited herself to answering just the first question (results), which she nevertheless considered to be useful.

Some participants reported to have encountered obstacles when using the questions in sessions with e.g., a customer, colleagues, or (large) projects. One such obstacle is that discussion partners of the participant were not used to these questions - particularly if they are asked explicitly. They experienced discomfort, and tried to avoid answering them while they (later on) recognized their importance.

Another observation was that the questions didn't always lead to satisfying results. It wasn't clear whether this was inherently due to the task, or the fact that the participants didn't yet have the experience to handle these situations.

Several participants reported to have used it to get their priorities straight, which led for some of them to skip some meetings. Another participant mentioned that the answers to the questions were a great help when writing a report, to determine what to write in it, and what not.

In the second feedback session, participants reported to have used the method
- to determine whether or not a task is sufficiently well-defined to start it;
- to clarify for themselves what the purpose/result of (recurring) meetings are;
- to decline meetings because it wasn't clear what it was for;
- to come to grips with writing a report (what (not) to write);
- lots of mails in the mailbox after holidays could be quickly deleted.

{{rewrite the sentence below with one word for 'bold' ('audacious', 'uppish')}}
One participant mentioned that it can be hard to be 'bold' ('audacious', 'uppish') and ask the questions out loud, particularly to senior colleagues. This led to an exchange of suggestions for formulating a mail in which these questions would be asked in a way that was 'safe' to send, and that would lead to their being answered.

There were also participants that reported having done less with the method than the three weeks before. This resulted in an awareness that it would have been handy at times if they had done it.

Participants reported the following effects:
- it saved them energy that was otherwise spent in frustration;
- answers help to work in a more structured fashion;
- the method give me more peace of mind;
- the feedback sessions are educational - people learn from one another, and sharing personal experiences becomes less of a problem;

In the third feedback session, one participant reported to have used the method to inventory the stakeholders and their wishes regarding the functioning of an IT prototype. Without the method, this result would have been the same, but it would have taken longer to produce.

Another participant reported to have used the method for getting answers regarding a project result. Neither the project manager, nor the customer could provide the answer. Using an informed guess for answers, this suited both of them. These answers serve the purpose of justifying the end result to the customer and project manager, and they were happy with them. It was noticed that in situations like these, there is an opportunity to phrase the answers in such a way that it simultaneously provides room for the participant to experiment with, or learn things that he might otherwise not have been able to learn, or experiment with. So while answering the questions don't always provide actual answers, they may still be useful as they can identify additional opportunities.

After a demo (that was built with specific answers to the questions) was successfully demonstrated in a technical context, the idea came up to also demonstrate it to management. It was reported that the t3 method helped to identify the concrete direction and changes that would be required to prepare for such a demonstration. It felt that time was efficiently spent, and they felt more secure than if they had done it in the usual way.

An effect that a participant mentioned in the context of writing a report was that 
- it had saved some 20% of the time spent;
- the quality was higher than would otherwise have been the case, because it was made explicit what the intended audience could do with it, which would otherwise not have been the case.

A participant in the project manager role reported that when he was faced with setting up a project that consists of various work packages (WPs), held a meeting with the envisaged WP-leaders, in which he presented the projects goals, and the subgoals of the WPs in terms of answers to the t3-questions, which he subsequently discussed with them. This resulted in a team that had a well-defined direction to progress in, which was shown by the fact that various WP-leaders used the slides of their WPs later on as an anchor of what they were trying to realize.

A participant that joined a project while it was running for 1+ years, tried to obtain answers to the t3-questions, only to find that project members were, and remained reluctant to provide answers to such questions.

## 6. Practicalities

{{this chapter is going to contain advise or suggestions that result both from lessons learned in the Groningen experiment and also from what the literature suggests that would help to overcome the human behaviours that prevented the method from properly working (as elaborated on in the problem statement section). So write a few introductory to introduce the following sections. Then, create a section header for every suggestion you have, given the Groningen Experiment and the literature mentioned in the Problem Statement section. Next, write a small prompt (like this one between the double curly braces) for each of these sections that you could then later execute to provide the actual contents.}}


## 7. Conclusion

{{this chapter is going to contain a summary of the problems, the t3-method, the things we did to validate the method, and an explicit conclusion stating the validity of the method - indicating the contexts for which that conclusion holds if that is relevant/appropriate. Somewhere in the text it will state what readers can do that want themselves to start practicing the method.}}

## Appendix A - Invitation mail {#appendix-a}

Here below is the mail we sent to our colleagues in Groningen to invite them to the introductory session. On hindsight, the list of dates for the feedback sessions should have been left out, because it did not contribute to the purpose of the mail, which is to enable recipients to decide whether or not to come to the first one. Also, these dates, however carefully selected, turned out to be impractical once we knew who the participants were. So the next time we will leave them out, which also shortens the mail which helps recipients to actually read it.

Dear Groningen Colleagues

We (Willem (de Kok) and Rieks) want to conduct an experiment in which we expose you to a method that we think and hope is going to help you save time in projects, and become more efficient and effective as you do activities – both within and outside projects; basically, every time you use the method. We also think/hope that the time you will save during such activities can be spent to reduce work stress – which would NOT work if you becoming more effective and efficient leads to your taking on more work.

The ‘research questions’ we would like to get an answer to include:
-	How easy is it for people to use this method? Alternatively: what are the difficulties people encounter in using it, and what can be done to help them overcome them?
-	Can we get some grip on how much more efficient and effective people become as they use this method?
-	How will people use the time they save in this way?
The experiment consists of a number of sessions (which are physical meetings in Groningen, on Thursdays, and include lunch for those of you that accept).
-	Thursday, May 30th will be the first session. In this session, we will explain the method that we want you start using, answer any questions you may have so that you can decide whether or not to participate in the experiment, and if so: you have everything you need to participate, and you know what we expect of you.
-	Thursday, June 20th will be the second session, in which you report on how things have gone with you. We will inventory any problems, find solutions, etc. so that you can continue with the experiment and become more proficient in the method as you keep using it.
-	Thursday, July 4th will be the third session, similar to the second one.
-	Thursday, July 18th will be the fourth session, similar to the second and third. Also, we will see how things go and what we should agree upon so that the experiment can last over the summer holidays, and we can have a concluding session somewhere in September. Doing this allows us to learn what the effect of holidays is on your use of the method (do you fall back in your ‘old’ behaviour or does it stick).

I hope you will join us for the first session (and also that you will be participating in the experiment, of course).

Lunch will be provided for everyone who will be joining live in Groningen. Courtesy of Fit For Your Future!

All the best,

Rieks and Willem

## Appendix B - Answers to T3 method questions by the Organizers {#appendix-b}

Here are the answers to the T3 method questions of the organizers of the introductory workshop.

What Willem and Rieks Are Doing Here

**What concrete results do we expect to see at the end of this kick-off session?**
1. Answers to these three questions by all participants of the kick-off session.
2. A list that contains the names of the people that have committed to participate in the experiment.
3. A “Statement of Commitment”, that explains what such a commitment entails.
4. For each of these people: a personalized set of activities that they will, or won’t be doing in the course of the experiment.
5. A list of actions that we can undertake to facilitate people in their participation.

**Who do we know/think will actually be using these results?**
- The people that are on the list (for results 3, 4, 5).
- Willem, and myself (results 1 – 5).

**What is it that they must be able to do with these results?**
- **Individuals on the list**: know (also after some time) what they have committed to (3, 4), execute the personalized set of activities (4), and know where/when/whether they get what kind of support (5).
- **Willem, and Rieks**: organize feedback sessions (order lunches), get an initial feeling of what people (dis)like about the method and the problems that might arise during the experiment, so that we can support them to overcome the difficulties. We will also use the results as input for a F4F-report memo.

## Appendix C - Template for Commitment Statement {#appendix-b}

Here is the text that was proposed to potential participants to commit to:

1. The commitment consists of 
  - Answering the three questions (what is the result? Who will actually be using it? What must they be able to do with the results) before the start of any activity.
  - Regularly (when needed) assess whether the activity is still ‘on track’, or answers must be adjusted to reflect the (changed) reality.
2. Participants keep a diary/notes, in which they:
  - state which particular kinds of activities they include, or exclude
  - regularly log how things go, such as 
    - difficulties they encounter, ways they resolved them; what does (not) work,
    - benefits and drawbacks of (not) having answered the questions for a particular activity (both before engaging in an activity and while executing it).
    - any other observations that might be worth remembering/sharing,
3. Participants will participate in the feedback sessions to share their experience and learn from each other, which are planned for the following dates: 
   - [*placeholder for a list of dates*]
4. The commitment terminates at the end of September, 2024.
